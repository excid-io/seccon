          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            The rapid adoption of containerization introduces security risks, making 
            it imperative for organizations to implement robust security measures 
            throughout the container lifecycle to prevent vulnerabilities and 
            misconfigurations that could lead to breaches or data loss. It comes 
            as no surprise that the software supply chain becomes often the target 
            of high-profile attackers, such as state-sponsored cyber-terrorism 
            groups, which launch advanced persistent attacks that are very hard 
            to detect and with widespread impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            SecCon will use as starting point Linux Foundation's <a href="https://www.sigstore.dev">Sigstore</a> tools, 
            as integrated in ExcID's open-source <a href="https://staas.excid.io/">Software Transparency as a Service</a> (STaaS) 
            platform to increase the security of the container images used in aerOS through traceability. 
            StaaS provides and immutable, auditable, non-blockchain-based log, leveraging open-source 
            TRL-9 components developed by Google, currently supporting planet-scale workloads.
